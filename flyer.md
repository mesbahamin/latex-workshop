LaTex Crash Course
A 60 minute crash course
Offered by the STEM Program

LaTeX: An incredibly powerful tool that makes writing lab reports easy and painless!

LaTeX (pronounced "LAY-tek") is used by scientists and academics to make formatting documents easy. Ubiquitous in academia, it is commonly used to create scientific journal articles. It has many other uses, including flyers (This poster was made with LaTeX!), books, and slideshows.

Many LACC science classes encourage the use of LaTeX for lab reports, and some offer extra credit.

In this 60 minute workshop you will learn the basics of writing with LaTeX.
